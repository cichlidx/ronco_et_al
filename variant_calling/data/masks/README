The mappability masks were generated using Heng Li's SNPable tools, with k=100bp (for 100bp reads):
http://lh3lh3.users.sourceforge.net/snpable.shtml
Simply put - the masks show regions where we are not able to confidently call SNPs using short 100bp reads, because the reads could map to multiple places
This folder containst masks with four levels of stringency:
mapability_mask_100_90.bed - fewer than 90% of overlapping 100bp sequences could be matched back uniquely and without 1-difference (265Mbp)
mapability_mask_100_95.bed - fewer than 95% of overlapping 100bp sequences could be matched back uniquely and without 1-difference (286Mbp)
