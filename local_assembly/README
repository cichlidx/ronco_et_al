Scripts and data files in this directory perform local assembly of candidate phylogenetic markers, using the programs aTRAM and Kollector. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system; however, aTRAM databases were mostly prepared on a laptop computer with a solid-state drive because the hard disk drives of the SGE were found to write these databases orders of magnitudes slower. File src/run_all.sh specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but run_all.sh itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed).


Before running scripts in src:

- Fastq files for specimens listed in data/tables/specimen_ids.txt must be placed in data/fastq.


Notes:

- Files orenil_exons.fasta and orenil_exons_nucl.fasta in data/queries are copied from nuclear_queries_selection/res/queries of the 'age_determination' directory.
