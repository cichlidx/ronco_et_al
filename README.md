# CichlidX script repository

**Repository for scripts used in Ronco et al. (resubmitted).**

Directories correspond to different types of analyses as described below.

## local_assembly

Scripts and data files in this directory perform local assembly of candidate phylogenetic markers, using the programs aTRAM and Kollector. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system; however, aTRAM databases were mostly prepared on a laptop computer with a solid-state drive because the hard disk drives of the SGE were found to write these databases orders of magnitudes slower. File [`run_all.sh`](local_assembly/src/run_all.sh) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](local_assembly/README) file in directory [`local_assembly`](local_assembly).

## age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection

Scripts and data files in this directory enable the selection of query sequences for the downstream identification of orthologs in distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection/src`](age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection/README) file in directory [`age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection`](age_determination/nuclear_queries_selection).

## age_determination/ortholog_identification

Scripts and data files in this directory identify sets of orthologs in distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](age_determination/ortholog_identification/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`age_determination/ortholog_identification/src`](age_determination/ortholog_identification/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](age_determination/ortholog_identification/README) file in directory [`age_determination/ortholog_identification`](age_determination/ortholog_identification).

## age_determination/introgression_detection

Scripts and data files in this directory perform tests for introgression among distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](age_determination/introgression_detection/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`age_determination/introgression_detection/src`](age_determination/introgression_detection/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](age_determination/introgression_detection/README) file in directory [`age_determination/introgression_detection `](age_determination/introgression_detection).

## age_determination/phylogenetic_inference

Scripts and data files in this directory perform phylogenetic analyses of distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups, including time-calibrated analyses that allow the estimation of the age of the Lake Tanganyika cichlid radiation. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](age_determination/phylogenetic_inference/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`age_determination/phylogenetic_inference/src`](age_determination/phylogenetic_inference/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](age_determination/phylogenetic_inference/README) file in directory [`age_determination/phylogenetic_inference`](age_determination/phylogenetic_inference).

## variant_calling

Scripts and data files in this directory perform mapping, variant calling, and phasing for genomes of species from the Lake Tanganyika cichlid radiation, plus a few outgroup species. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](variant_calling/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`variant_calling/src`](variant_calling/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](variant_calling/README) file in directory [`age_determination/phylogenetic_inference`](variant_calling).

## mitochondrial_phylogenetics

Scripts and data files in this directory perform mitochondrial assembly and phylogenetic inference from these assemblies. Scripts are written to be run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](mitochondrial_phylogenetics/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`mitochondrial_phylogenetics/src`](mitochondrial_phylogenetics/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](mitochondrial_phylogenetics/README) file in directory [`mitochondrial_phylogenetics`](mitochondrial_phylogenetics).

## lt_phylogenomics

Scripts and data files in this directory perform various methods for phylogenetic inference for species from the Lake Tanganyika cichlid radiation, plus a few outgroup species. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File [`run_all.sh`](lt_phylogenomics/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`lt_phylogenomics/src`](lt_phylogenomics/src) specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but `run_all.sh` itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed). Required preparatory steps are listed in the [`README`](lt_phylogenomics/README) file in directory [`lt_phylogenomics `](lt_phylogenomics).

## f4-ratio_analyses

The included R script [`f4-ratio_downstreamAnalyses.R`](f4-ratio_analyses/f4-ratio_downstreamAnalyses.R) can be used for analysing introgression on the basis of f4-ratio results produced by Dsuite ([Malinsky et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1101/634477)). The Dsuite output is included in the same folder. 

## heterozygosity_simulations

Scripts in this directory perform coalescent simulations on the basis of the Lake Tanganyika species tree allowing various levels of within-tribe migration. The complete analysis can be run by executing the script [`run_all.sh`](heterozygosity_simulations/src/run_all.sh) in directory [`heterozygosity_simulations/src`](heterozygosity_simulations/src).
