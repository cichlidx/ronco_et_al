Scripts and data files in this directory identify sets of orthologs in distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File src/run_all.sh specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but run_all.sh itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed).


Before running scripts in src:

- A number of programs must be available as modules. To see which program versions are required, and how modules should be named, use 'cat src/* | grep -v "#" | grep "module load" | sort | uniq'. Adjust module names as needed.

- All files ending matching *.kollector.fasta in res/kollector of the 'local_assembly' directory must be placed in data/subjects/local/kollector.

- All files ending matching *.atram.fasta in res/atram of the 'local_assembly' directory must be placed in data/subjects/local/atram.

- Whole-genome assemblies generated with CeleraAssembler (see Supplementary Material for CeleraAssembler settings) for the specimens listed in data/tables/cichlid_specimens.txt must be placed in data/subjects/local/celera.

- The program BMGE must be placed in bin and named BMGE.jar.

- Version 7.2.8 of RAxML must be placed in bin and named raxmlHPC.

- Code for the program concaterpillar must be placed in bin/concaterpillar.
