Scripts and data files in this directory perform phylogenetic analyses of distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups, including time-calibrated analyses that allow the estimation of the age of the Lake Tanganyika cichlid radiation. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File src/run_all.sh specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but run_all.sh itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed).


Before running scripts in src:

- A number of programs must be available as modules. To see which program versions are required, and how modules should be named, use 'cat src/* | grep -v "#" | grep "module load" | sort | uniq'. Adjust module names as needed.

- The content of res/alignments/nuclear in directory 'age_determination/ortholog_identification' must be copied to data/alignments.

- The content of res/trees/nuclear in directory 'age_determination/ortholog_identification' must be copied to data/trees.

- The program ASTRAL must be placed in bin/Astral and named astral.5.6.3.jar.
