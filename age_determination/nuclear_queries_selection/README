Scripts and data files in this directory enable the selection of query sequences for the downstream identification of orthologs in distantly related cichlid lineages and non-cichlid outgroups. Scripts are written to run on an SGE queuing system. File src/run_all.sh specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but run_all.sh itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed).


Before running scripts in src:

- A number of programs must be available as modules. To see which program versions are required, and how modules should be named, use 'cat src/* | grep -v "#" | grep "module load" | sort | uniq'. Adjust module names as needed.

- File mart_export.txt must be generated from https://www.ensembl.org/biomart as shown with screenshots in data/tables and placed in data/tables.
