### Phenotype files:

all_bodyshape.tps # TPS files containing Landmark data derived from 2D x-rays (body shape including upper oral jaw), datasets were previously checked for outliers (e.g. swapped or missing landmarks); no Landmarks are missing (negative landmarks are actual coordinates)

all_LPJ.tps # TPS files containing Landmark data derived from 3D CT-scans (lower pharyngeal jaw), datasets were previously checked for outliers (e.g. swapped or missing landmarks); no Landmarks are missing

baseline.csv ### contains Baseline stable isotope data (d15N and d13C) from the northern and southern basin of Lake Tanganyika
SI_data.csv ### contains stable isotope data (d15N and d13C) from cichlids of Lake Tanganyika
SI_data_n_s_distribution.csv ### contains stable isotope data (d15N and d13C) from 19 cichlid species of Lake Tanganyika with a like-wide distribution, which we sampled at different sampling localities (n = north; s= south), this file mostly constitutes a subset of “SI_data.csv”, however for 2 species (“Lepatt” and “Benhor”) additional samples are provided

scores_pigmentation_pattern.csv ### scored pigmentation pattern for all species 


########################
### Tree files:

b1.tre 	## time-calibrated species tree based on the maximum-likelihood topology estimated with RAxML
b2.tre  ## time-calibrated species tree based on the the topology estimated with ASTRAL
b3.tre  ## time-calibrated species tree based on the topology estimated with SNAPP


########################
### files containing additional information:

specimen_voucher_key.csv. ### translation table for the specimen voucher IDs, including species abbreviations, full species names, and sampling locations with GPS coordinates
Species_TO_tribe.csv #### a table which links the six-letter species code to tribe information
colors_tribes.txt ### Colour code table to assign tribe colours for plotting
