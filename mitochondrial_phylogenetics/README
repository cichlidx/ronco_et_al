Scripts and data files in this directory perform mitochondrial assembly and phylogenetic inference from these assemblies. Scripts are written to be run on an SGE queuing system. File src/run_all.sh specifies in which sequence scripts should be run (but run_all.sh itself should not be executed as it would trigger scripts before upstream scripts have completed).


Before running scripts in src:

- A number of programs must be available as modules. To see which program versions are required, and how modules should be named, use 'cat src/* | grep -v "#" | grep module | sort | uniq'. Adjust module names as needed.

- In file src/convert_bams_to_fastqs.sh, PATH_TO_PICARD must be replaced with the path to picard.jar.

- In file src/make_mitochondrial_assembly.sh, PATH_TO_MITOBIM must be replaced with te path to MITObim_1.8.pl.

- Files with mapped reads in bam format must be placed in data/bam.

- The edited version of the orenil2 reference genome (GCF_001858045.1_ASM185804v2_genomic_edit.fna; see directory 'variant_calling') must be placed in data/reference and renamed to orenil2.fasta.
