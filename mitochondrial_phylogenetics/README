Scripts and data files in this directory allow reproducing mitochondrial assembly and phylogenetic inference from these assemblies. Scripts are written to be run on an SGE queuing system. File src/run_all.sh specifies in which sequence scripts should be run; however, 'bash run_all.sh' may not run all scripts from beginning to end, because the execution of one script may need to wait for jobs triggered by an upstream script to finish first.

Before running scripts in src:

- A number of programs must be available as modules. To see which program versions are required, and how modules should be named, use 'cat src/* | grep -v "#" | grep module | sort | uniq'. Adjust module names as needed.

- In file src/convert_bams_to_fastqs.sh, PATH_TO_PICARD must be replaced with the path to picard.jar.

- In file src/make_mitochondrial_assembly.sh, PATH_TO_MITOBIM must be replaced with te path to MITObim_1.8.pl.

- Files with mapped reads in bam format must be placed in data/bam.

- The edited version of the orenil2 reference genome (GCF_001858045.1_ASM185804v2_genomic_edit.fna; see directory 'variant_calling') must be placed in data/reference and renamed to orenil2.fasta.
